        <span>W</span>alter Elias Disney (December 5, 1901 â€“ December 15, 1966)
        was an American entrepreneur, animator, writer, voice actor and film
        producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced
        several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer,
        Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual,
        having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two
        Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other
        honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry
        by the Library of Congress.<br />

        Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney developed an early interest in drawing.
        He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers
        Studio with his brother Roy. With Ub Iwerks, Walt developed the
        character Mickey Mouse in 1928, his first highly popular success; he
        also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. The
        results, seen in features such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
        (1937), Pinocchio, Fantasia (both 1940), Dumbo (1941), and Bambi (1942),
        furthered the development of animated film. New animated and live-action
        films followed after World War II, including the critically successful
        Cinderella (1950) and Mary Poppins (1964), the latter of which received
        five Academy Awards.<br />

        In the 1950s, Disney expanded into the amusement park industry, and in
        1955 he opened Disneyland in Anaheim, California. In 1965, he began
        development of another theme park, Disney World, the heart of which was
        to be a new type of city, Disney was a heavy smoker throughout his life
        and died of lung cancer in December 1966 before either the park or the
        EPCOT project were completed. Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and
        insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona.
        He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he
        worked. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of
        animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is
        considered a national cultural icon.
