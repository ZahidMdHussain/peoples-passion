        <span>W</span>illiam Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an
        American business magnate, software developer, and philanthropist. He is
        best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation. During his career
        at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive
        officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being
        the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He is one of the
        best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of
        the 1970s and 1980s.<br />
        Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Gates co-founded Microsoft with
        childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975, in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it went
        on to become the world's largest personal computer software company.
        Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in
        January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software
        architect. During the late 1990s, he had been criticized for his
        business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. <br />
        In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a
        part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda
        Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his
        wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000. He gradually transferred his
        duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie. He stepped down as chairman of
        Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser
        to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella. In March 2020, Gates
        left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on
        his philanthropic endeavors including climate change, global health and
        development, and education.Since 1987, he has been included in the
        Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people. From 1995 to 2017, he held
        the Forbes title of the richest person in the world all but four of
        those years. In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO
        Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared
        to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time.
