The two were both intrigued with the idea of enhancing the ability to extract meaning from the mass of data accumulated on the Internet.

In an acquisition reflecting the company’s efforts to expand its services beyond Internet searches, In 2011 Page resumed his duties as Google’s CEO, Schmidt having moved to the position of executive chairman. Google was restructured in August 2015 as a subsidiary of the newly created holding company Alphabet Inc., and Page became CEO of Alphabet.
