        <span>S</span>teven Paul Jobs was an American business magnate,
        industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the
        chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc.,
        the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt
        Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar,
        and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as
        a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s,
        along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Jobs was born in San
        Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San
        Francisco Bay Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out
        that same year, and traveled through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment
        and studying Zen Buddhism.<br />

        Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I
        personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later
        with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced
        microcomputers. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry
        in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter. Jobs was forced out
        of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board
        and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few of
        Apple's members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development
        company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business
        markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry
        when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's
        Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first
        3D computer animated feature film Toy Story (1995).<br />

        He worked closely with designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products
        that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the
        "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes,
        iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In
        2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X
        (now known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a
        modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with
        a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003. He died of respiratory arrest
        related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011.
