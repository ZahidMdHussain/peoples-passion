        <span>E</span>lon Reeve Musk FRS is a business magnate, industrial
        designer and engineer. He is the founder, CEO, CTO and chief designer of
        SpaceX; early investor, CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.;
        founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and co-founder
        and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal
        Society (FRS) in 2018. Also that year, he was ranked 25th on the Forbes
        list of The World's Most Powerful People, and was ranked joint-first on
        the Forbes list of the Most Innovative Leaders of 2019. As of December
        19, 2020, Musk’s net worth was estimated by Forbes to US$153.5 billion,
        making him the second-richest person in the world, behind Jeff Bezos.<br />

        Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised
        in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of
        Pretoria before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's
        University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years
        later, where he received dual bachelor's degrees in economics and
        physics. He moved to California in 1995 to begin a Ph.D. in applied
        physics and material sciences at Stanford University, but dropped out
        after two days to pursue a business career. He co-founded Zip2, a web
        software company, which was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999.
        Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in
        2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was subsequently
        bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.<br />

        In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space
        transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He
        joined Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.), an electric vehicle
        manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded, becoming its
        product architect that year and its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped
        create SolarCity, a solar energy services company. In 2015, he
        co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote
        friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink,
        a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer
        interfaces. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an
        infrastructure and tunnel construction company focused on tunnels
        optimized for electric vehicles.
