        <span>A</span>lexander III of Macedon, commonly known as Alexander the
        Great, was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member
        of the Argead dynasty. He was born in Pella in 356 BC and succeeded his
        father Philip II to the throne at the age of 20. By the age of thirty,
        he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world,
        stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in
        battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful
        military commanders.<br />

        During his youth, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until age 16. After
        Philip's assassination in 336 BC, he succeeded his father to the throne
        and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was
        awarded the generalship of Greece. In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid
        Empire (Persian Empire) and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10
        years. Following the conquest of Anatolia, Alexander broke the power of
        Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of
        Issus and Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew Persian King Darius III
        and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. At that point, his
        empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Beas River.<br />

        Alexander endeavoured to reach the "ends of the world and the Great
        Outer Sea" and invaded India in 326 BC, winning an important victory
        over the Pauravas at the Battle of the Hydaspes. He eventually turned
        back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in Babylon in 323 BC,
        In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire
        apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the
        Diadochi. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of
        Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and mythic
        traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He was undefeated in
        battle and became the measure against which military leaders compared
        themselves. Military academies throughout the world still teach his
        tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in
        history.
